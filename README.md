# Random Quote Generator

This web app allows the user to click a button and receive a random quote from a side-loaded JSON file. The user can then click on the twitter icon to tweet the quote. If the quote is more than 140 characters including the attribution, a JavaScript function will truncate the quote before passing it along to Twitter. This project is fully responsive for mobile platforms.

This project is part of the Free Code Camp Front End Development certification.
